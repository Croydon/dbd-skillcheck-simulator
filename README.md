## Perks

The Killer Perks can be activated/dezactivated using 'Training' mode from the 'Game Mode' menu. Selecting 'Training' mode, will activate the selected perks at the maximum tier or at the maximum number of tokens(Hex: Huntress Lullaby). Each Killer Perk in 'Normal' mode will have 50% changes to activate, when starting a generator, then the perks will have 10% changes to activate/dezativate the effect during the game. For 'Decisive Strike' all perks will remain inactive.
  - Hex: Ruin (got nurfed in DBD but will remain here as a remainder)
  - Hex: Huntress Lullaby (at 5 totems skillchecks will spawn without a sound)
  - Unnerving Presence
